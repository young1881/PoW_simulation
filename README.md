# PoW_simulation

Use Python to implement a PoW simulation program to simulate the state of a certain number of nodes generating the blockchain.

- Setting parameters include: the number of nodes and the success rate of block generation in each round to measure the growth rate of the blockchain.
- Set up a certain number of malicious nodes to carry out attacks.
   - Measure the length of successful statistical fork attacks under different proportions of malicious nodes (10%-40%)
   - Proportion of selfish mining revenue under different proportions of malicious nodes
